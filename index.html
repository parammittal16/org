The server management is done through a friendly user interface (the \"platform”). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.\n\nThe installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users.

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.\n\nOver the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).\n\n# Paradigm\n\nappleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\n# Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engine’s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).\n\n# Timeline\n\nappleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).\n\nIn October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year.

The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world. Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, https://home.cern) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web.

Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n## Native Parallelism\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n## Data and Task Locality\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n## Multiresolution Philosophy\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n## Modern Language Features\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n## Interoperability\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/9ZDyifrWzjt9IKsKedHmCIrrcu2O8IqBhQZK6uaQyiVv3QWETz_mPa-6_P-0QmRE_XXXQe0TJ2N4DjG0SqHbHMw6cKNd2tBN","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ChapelLanguage","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"To apply for Google Summer of Code with Chapel, follow the instructions here: https://chapel-lang.org/gsoc/apply.html","topic_tags":["programming languages","compilers","high performance computing","distributed computing","parallel computing"],"technology_tags":["chapel","python","high performance computing","c","c++"],"proposal_tags":["libraries and applications","infrastructure and tooling","compiler"],"ideas_list":"http://chapel-lang.org/gsoc","contact_method":"chapel_info@cray.com","program_year":2019},{"id":6078625535754240,"name":"Checker Framework","slug":"checker-framework","website_url":"https://checkerframework.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/checker-framework-gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Prevent programming errors before they happen, via easy-to-use verification","precis":"We build tools for programmers, to prevent run-time errors at compile time.  These aren't just bug-finding tools.  Our tools give a guarantee, but are easy to use.","description":"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. For example, our web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. \n\nOur technologies have broad impact in education: Traditional didactic and textbook-based learning formats utilized in many life sciences courses create an environment that limits student ability to develop highly needed technical skills and fully conceptualize the complex and dynamic nature of biology and diseases. To address these challenges, our software technologies enable students ranging from high schools to undergraduate and graduate levels to learn about biology and diseases using by building, simulating, breaking, and re-analyzing computational models of these biological systems.\n\nOther technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/y_Wy6hoVtcuv6pjyvcWcxhu7KkYkm2iMcnYNTrS247vy1UmS6hpYTGuD0D6MrgGgw270V2T4n8lU4NP7Fui-gzo3UuNJn2Q","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"(Also available here: https://goo.gl/sR2tnN)\n\nWe would like to know who you are and how you think.

Idiomatic D programs are commonly as fast as hand-optimized C code, while being reportedly shorter and easier to write, read, and change. A gradual approach to memory safety allows safe programs to be largely automatically checked, whilst relying on small and fast manually-verified primitives.\n\nMetaprogramming in the D language relies on three core features. First, _compile-time evaluation_ allows user code to evaluate most D code (except calls into opaque functions or certain casts) during compilation. This allows for unparalleled compile-time processing abilities, without the need to learn a different metalanguage. Second, _static introspection_ allows D artifacts (such as modules, types, functions) to be inspected during compilation. This allows for component designs that adapt to one another at assemblage time, eliminating the rigidity of fixed interfaces - a paradigm becoming increasingly known as \"Design by Introspection\". Third, the D language allows strings computed during compilation to be fed back to the compiler. This allows arbitrarily complex code to be built from compact specifications such as regular expressions, EBNF/PEG grammars, SQL, automata, and many other DSLs. Each of these three pillars is enabled by the others, and the absence of any one of them would hamstring the power of the others.\n\nD's rich feature set offers many opportunities to a variety of projects, without them being ostensibly related to advanced metaprogramming facilities. High-performance code can be terse and highly optimized without the tedium of repeated coding patterns or hand-written specializations. Highly dynamic code can combine static and dynamic language features in an expressive whole. The best, most innovative ways to use the D language are yet to be discovered.\n\nYou can learn more about [D's feature set and design at dlang.org](https://dlang.org/overview.html)","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Boost Software License (BSL-1.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MoQCxUqdIfOdb4nyOtRhTOos-nWwQjXl3T7mG3Ew5R2hu0NVk6HvNFuBtpsU6EMVYfyy4d7q1TyUSxgxZ-WsRIXsoM8PSA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/D_Programming","blog_url":"https://dlang.org/blog","application_instructions":"Your application should include the following:\n\n- Detailed road-map with bi-weekly milestones\n- Your skill set in your project domain (related courses or programming experience)\n- Potential hurdles (be honest, but include how you plan to resolve them)\n- Benefit of your project to the D community\n- Links to Open Source contributions\n- GitHub username + email address\n- Other commitments over the summer (courses, planned vacations)\n\nPlease refer to [our Google Summer of Code 2016 Postmortem](https://dlang.org/blog/2017/01/13/the-d-language-foundation-google-summer-of-code-2016-postmortem/) for details on our selection process.\n\nAdvice:\n- Discuss your project idea on the [D forums](http://forum.dlang.org)\n- Get in touch with your mentors\n- Be active and start to contribute on GitHub\n- Read the [FLOSS guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/writing-a-proposal/)\nand [Google's excellent FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)","topic_tags":["programming languages","object-oriented programming","functional programming","web programming","system programming"],"technology_tags":["dlang","linux","windows","osx","bsd"],"proposal_tags":["language interop","compilers","standard library","data","numerics","machine learning","package manager","graphics","your own proposal"],"ideas_list":"https://wiki.dlang.org/GSOC_2019_Ideas","contact_method":"social@dlang.org","program_year":2019},{"id":4820145699028992,"name":"DBpedia","slug":"dbpedia","website_url":"http://dbpedia.org","category":"data_and_databases","contact_email":"dbpedia@infai.org","mailing_list":"https://wiki.dbpedia.org/join/get-in-touch","irc_channel":"https://wiki.dbpedia.org/join/get-in-touch","tagline":"Global and Unified Access to Knowledge.","precis":"We are a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured content from various Wikimedia projects.

These tools are also free.\n\nOf course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 51000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\n\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/qStiU-8GgDBd6tw9j0StDWrLiRRqbesESQ3w2EotDTebU5IfGblgNtAjdTJdcjy8bZreCZ7vGDaMRdsLg42JbjCTaDMSXA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/debian","blog_url":"https://planet.debian.org/","application_instructions":"Please checkout the [Projects page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2019/Projects) on the Debian wiki.

It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems.

It is also the Brazilian branch of the [FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/ \"FrameNet\") initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. \nFrame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 90 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nWhat is Software Radio?\nThe [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) on Software Radio provides an excellent overview. In brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/A2LS7ueGW4zbLrMov0B3ya3SOq4QByDxsOi_7WcK6RuvYLCG-Ck7DrTI10Hdy4dLVrR0mDX6QwfqbMb2-fScJwFogxrYz7sH","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/gnuradio","blog_url":"https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/","application_instructions":"We have a wiki page that collects a lot of useful and important information for interested students: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GSoCStudentInfo\n\nIt includes a lot of information on how to select your project, how to write a successful proposal, and what we expect from you, should your proposal be accepted.\n\nWe are looking forward to your proposal(s)!","topic_tags":["software defined radio","software radio","radar","wireless communications","digital signal processing"],"technology_tags":["python","c++","qt","android"],"proposal_tags":["radar","qt","grc","dsp","sigmf"],"ideas_list":"https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GSoCIdeas","contact_method":"https://www.gnuradio.org/about/","program_year":2019},{"id":6553848640962560,"name":"Godot Engine","slug":"godot-engine","website_url":"https://godotengine.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"gsoc@godotengine.org","mailing_list":"","irc_channel":"https://godotengine.org/community","tagline":"Multi-platform fully-featured 2D and 3D game engine","precis":"Godot is a multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine with a feature-rich editor.\nHundreds of contributors develop it, and thousands more use it to make games or multimedia applications.","description":"## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine\n\n[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.

We deal with the question of how the software development process can be improved. Through visualizations we make the abstract problems of software development more understandable and accessible. In recent years, we have built up a great deal of knowledge in this field and published at international scientific conferences together with scientists from all over the world. Since last year, we have concentrated to put scientific findings into practice. Our innovative open source project [Getaviz](https://github.com/getaviz/Getaviz) transfers the knowledge of the scientific community of software visualization into helpful tools for software developers. With the support of our growing community we are designing visualizations for exploring the structure, behavior, and evolution of software artifacts in 2D, 3D, virtual reality, and augmented reality.

Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).\n\n## What technologies do we use? \nThe InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\n\n## What sort of data does InterMine have? \nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own organisms, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was a GSoC project!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n\n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! We aim to help scientists make sense of such ambiguity, diversity and complexity.\n\nOne way to help is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \n\nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, we aim to write code that can be easily deployed on any of them.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/TwTr2BOtvZoB1dKDgstgN3YAGL3tjfA30rzgMBxIHn459j5RgKktTDvSvJQSEp1qurcaQe77pwUwG9RhCLOkGghCG0xVx0EB","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/intermineorg/","blog_url":"https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/","application_instructions":"Please visit http://intermine.org/gsoc/ to learn more about InterMine and how to contribute and apply. \n\nWe encourage students to join the #gsoc channel at chat.intermine.org to meet mentors and ask any questions they have.","topic_tags":["bioinformatics"," web"," open science"," biology"," data visualisation"],"technology_tags":["java"," python"," javascript"," clojure"," r"],"proposal_tags":["clojure testing","interminer","imjs and imtables","js data vis","dataset versioning","schema validator","restful webservices in spring","similarity finder","linkout project"],"ideas_list":"http://intermine.org/gsoc/project-ideas/2019/","contact_method":"info@intermine.org","program_year":2019},{"id":6482109326163968,"name":"Internet Archive","slug":"internet-archive","website_url":"https://archive.org","category":"other","contact_email":"iagsoc2019@gmail.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Universal Access to All Knowledge","precis":"Help the Internet Archive pursue of the mission of \"Universal Access to All Knowledge\"","description":"Help the Internet Archive further develop and improve the Wayback Machine and the Open Library.  \n\n- Continue development of the Chrome extension “Wayback Machine”. \n- Continue development of the Google Assistant Action (Voice App) “Internet Archive”\n- Contribute to the development of the OpenLibrary.org\n- Improve the scope, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Wayback Machine’s web crawling and archiving operations\n- Contribute to the Archive.org component system","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5u3s_yalmIs4A71pksueahxFUDwoo8tQe5xquxBdPk4Rtax6tC9lLroOqWibbs9Z-tcIZOYuz3WKWNOQy5ykAx6kjhjpd4Dt","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/internetarchive","blog_url":"http://blog.archive.org","application_instructions":"Please email your proposals to iagsoc2019@gmail.com","topic_tags":["library","archive","web archives"],"technology_tags":["python","javascript","node.js","php","elasticsearch"],"proposal_tags":["\"open library\"","google actions","wayback machine"],"ideas_list":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1posF4zhq2lAz7eikloT9_K4LnHXfJ5VWGpCtJS6rJ0M/edit?usp=sharing","contact_method":"iagsoc2019@gmail.com","program_year":2019},{"id":4895798387539968,"name":"Internet Systems Consortium","slug":"internet-systems-consortium","website_url":"https://isc.org","category":"other","contact_email":"info@isc.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.isc.org","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"We support the infrastructure of the Internet with Open Source","precis":"DNS and DHCP are core technologies critical for networking and the Internet.

It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\n## What is Céu?\n\nCéu provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it. Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pOGAG-jU7fxXF76ZCQm12y4QS13XQCZW54bWBL-oKd826KNWoRnzI0094MoUiWYoILVGjb6cEWxZschVQmJ3-JMrc8argg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"# Applying to Google Summer of Code at LabLua\n\n## The ideas list\n\nCheck out our ideas web page or propose your own!\n\n## Getting in touch\n\nYou are encouraged to contact us before submitting your application.

It is designed as an open source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station that is accessed via a web page for all of the network users. A basic ground station can be made up of commercial off the shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas. To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing 100+ stations are on-line in the [SatNOGS Network](https://network.satnogs.org) and 50+ are tested globally by University cubesat teams, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the [SatNOGS DataBase](https://db.satnogs.org) and are visualized in the [SatNOGS Dashboard](https://dashboard.satnogs.org).\n\nLibre Space together with the University of Patras are also the makers of [UPSat](https://upsat.gr), the 1st free software, open-hardware cubesat. \n\nLibre Space Foundation is also implementing the [European Space Agency](https://esa.int) activity [SDR Maker Space](https://SDRmaker.space) working on several open-source Software Defined Radio sub-activities, to facilitate satellite communications.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci_5JmvCJpf9FSeueZqgza5E3Fm2OlwQHpBAcvAQbdb0Kcj1MFjXntZiN-ZnZ4uLbFQxCoEpxoGMRgKVI7d90J3wYaXtaA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/librespace_fnd","blog_url":"https://libre.space/category/updates/","application_instructions":"Detailed guidance and instructions to participate on GSOC with Libre Space Foundation [are available here](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/soc-org/wikis/Google-Summer-of-Code-2019/).\n\nGSoC is a great opportunity for students to get paid to work on an open source project.

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher.

The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations.

Liquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly. The Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open source software, although it is free (as in beer).

These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n  * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n  * The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n  * The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n  * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n  * The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm.

Changes in behaviour, new SQL commands, etc. Do not talk about function names, algorithms or data structures here.\n* _How do you want to do it?_ Here you should describe your project in term of internals, function names, algorithms and data structures. What do you want to change and how. Try to show that you know what you're talking about and not simply copied from the project ideas page.\n* _When do you plan to do what?_ Present the timeline here. What will be ready when? Structure your work so that you could test new code immediately, implement your project in small steps that could be tested incrementally. Reserve at least 40% of the time for testing.\n\nNote, you will almost certainly write a better proposal and will improve your chance of being accepted if you'll discuss your project first on the mailing list or Zulip/IRC.\nAfter you've filed the proposal, you might receive a reply from a mentor with a test assignment.

Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP’s requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today’s focus on where — addresses and hosts — to what — the content that users and applications care about.\n\nThe Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet architecture that can capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of the Internet’s current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth. The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture: routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications. NDN Technical Report NDN-0001 “[Named Data Networking (NDN) Project](http://named-data.net/techreport/TR001ndn-proj.pdf)” is a slightly modified version of the NDN project proposal.\n\nThe NDN project was funded by NSF in September 2010 as one of the four projects under NSF’s [Future Internet Architecture Program](http://www.nets-fia.net/).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NqCpQt2jEMBtC2alk1Z45vej7EOWYMSqRDMbkT_2vHGiLuiGYGqesEKXsJfkYWtFc1sTwN6FOiBFLbF1W9HzmvRpyxd-pFC2","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/nameddata","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"General information:\nA knowledge of networking and more specifically content/information centric networking is preferred.

This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.\n\nIn April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows.

EIA International and local activists protect it by documenting forest crimes with ODK. The geo-tagged forms, rich with photos, provide the evidence needed to save habitat. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/109241884).\n* Evaluating global health programs involves collecting, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data. Population Council, Marie Stopes Uganda, and Gobee Group use ODK to streamline the process. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/38123850).\n* The Jane Goodall Institute uses ODK to empower local communities to better manage and monitor their forests. ODK lets these communities connect directly with the global carbon marketplace and demonstrate the concrete benefits of their efforts to protect the forest. [Watch video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CNXv8EEs0P8). \n* The Carter Center uses ODK to get the real-time data needed to assess elections.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/6X5LCCgRgvV8fdzCGjiw6bZHLsQs4jC3P4tyOa2V4ybw55jghg-1KAEowy3RpHwZfArMR31gj92uM7-ow6fPlNd8vr724w","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"https://blog.openmrs.org","application_instructions":"This proposal must describe in detail how you would plan to approach the project, and must include goals and a draft timeline.

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/iBIoNCYUx9k3vMq0MT9nPf07_jWnRb02fI7PIuCdnVpAkAIo5e-6jlytHt0hF0LAKoFuyJWPvHUN9Bdk5TrkuYQEcIlgVjg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openwisp","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"In order to apply with us, you can send us your written application as a PDF document or a link to a  google document.\n\nYour applications should include at least the information below; feel free to add more detail regarding how you intend to implement the solution to the project you are choosing.\n\n**1.

The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative lesson creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/7BfwUKijYgjldzgD5rLkzwh_kWvwWfgRXfxvxEnMocz-xvV76NmXcOC0qvYFa-VGr87wJyXTJqw7beLtH20V04mUBcVnV9k","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"","blog_url":"https://medium.com/oppia-org","application_instructions":"Please see our dedicated GSoC 2019 wiki page [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2019) for info about project ideas, what we’re looking for in a proposal, a proposal template, and how to apply to Oppia for GSoC.

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.\n\n# How does PEcAn do that? #\n\nPEcAn consists of **1)** state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, **2)** a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and **3)** a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters. Lastly, we're moving to use software containers to make PEcAn even more light weight and easy to use as well as implementing an API to turn PEcAn into a SaaS product.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/UHX-At-rWAC-M7svbf4T1Gg1kJWyVoQyoWK0v_Pq0eZ3rJcQE7KeuyjTU6rl62vgBNpjHftxFn3KnbDiIxQeIK-fkxNMLHfS","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/pecanproject?lang=en","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"To apply:\nThere are two parts to the application process.

Not only that, but GStreamer is cross-platform, and is also used on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.\n\nIn addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can easily use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.\n\n## Tooling\n\nThe many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex.

We’re looking forward to our members in Africa and Asia! We use a variety of means to communicate, including a Google Group for announcements and a forum for discussions.\n\nPANOPTES occupies a unique niche in the ongoing search for exoplanets. Previous missions, such as Kepler, have focused primarily on one region of the sky, taking deep images in order to discover transiting exoplanets around mostly distant stars, leading to limited opportunities for imaging follow up as the majority of the targets are far away and dim. Current projects aim to fill this gap by targeting relatively bright and near stars, but continue to utilize expensive equipment and optimal site locations in order to ensure success, thus limiting the ability of the project to grow and adapt. \n\nPANOPTES is attractive because it can complement these missions, doing so cheaply and with the involvement of citizen scientists. And while the primary scientific interest of the PANOPTES project is to aid in the discovery of exoplanets via the transit-detection technique, PANOPTES is also a platform. We encourage other groups to come up with projects which use PANOPTES data, hardware or software to address other scientific questions, such as supernovae, near-earth objects (NEO), space debris, and more.

Make sure you have at least an overarching concept of our mission, the nature of our research, our data, and the range of the example tasks we have provided to guide your imagination. Formulate a pre-proposal of of 1-3 pages that outlines your project idea. Spell out in detail what kind of data you need and the broad steps of your process through the summer, including the basic tools you propose to use. Give careful consideration to your input requirements; in some cases, we will be able to provide annotations for the feature you need, but in other cases successful applicants will craft their own metadata, or work with us to recruit help to generate it. If Red Hen Lab is invited to participate in Google Summer of Code 2019, to be announced on 26 February 2019, you may send your pre-proposal to redhenlab@gmail.com. Being able to generate a meaningful pre-proposal is a requirement for joining the team.

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\nScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.\n\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\n- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/F0evfum_rgGWvCA_Qfi1B5RMawLVFg-s2pmOgaNBud9Uw7iqVPKxi6uZ_srpThQQSdxM4x6f3xoJiSWOJkz3fmYuIxc8rg","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/scummvm","blog_url":"http://planet.scummvm.org/","application_instructions":"Your application has two important purposes: It should clearly identify the goals of your project, and it should convince us that you are the right person for this task.\n\nIn particular, your application is your opportunity to show us that you understand what you'll be doing for the task, and to demonstrate that you've spent some time thinking about it, its difficulties, strategies for overcoming these, and have a good estimate of how much time they will take.

A big roadblock to wider adoption are the specific tools that need to be learned on a per-vendor basis and their proprietary licensing.\n\nBy working to implement a **vendor neutral** and **modular** flow that is **easy to integrate** with various types of other tools, and more closely corresponds to a development experience known to the wider software development community ever since GCC was created, SymbiFlow is meant to drastically accelerate software-driven innovation in FPGA development.\n\nSymbiFlow is already enabling new tools, development platforms and communities that build around the end-to-end open flow that is already working for some platforms. But there is still a lot of work ahead!\n\nTo achieve SymbiFlow's goal of a complete FOSS FPGA toolchain, a number of tools and projects are necessary to provide all the needed components of an end-to-end flow. Thus, SymbiFlow serves as an umbrella project for several activities, the central of which pertains to the creation of so-called [FPGA \"architecture definitions\"](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs), i.e. documentation of how specific FPGAs work internally.\n\nThose definitions and serve as input to open source backend tools like nextpnr and Verilog to Routing, and frontend tools like Yosys.

You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.\n\nWith Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.\n\nMain features\n===========\n\n**- Vector tweening**\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.\n\n**- Layers and Filters**\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others. \n\n**- Bones**\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.\n\n**- Linking elements**\nYou can link parameters of various layers – directly or through mathematical expressions.

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional intelligence, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/l4D5bAwiJzO6uSD6Lt0_NqXM-R8nCb6SJeC_uUG7cPjPH6741YhbXsJ0ZD6GuatpeApW2skJgRZRt9X3VfPzmgIdL2nVxw","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"https://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"Every year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Labs. of America, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android.

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017).

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/VBgvYZSBOs4Qzq0EJ7gQOvWEFhyDDKfGbRT4CSvNZF6Wua4k3PaaZ39tfFeKbrv6arSegP0l9hcjtKjkPyhLFtfcTJ1MPQM","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/processingorg","blog_url":"https://medium.com/processing-foundation","application_instructions":"Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation!

However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data. The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design. This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams. On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. Tools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ceDOz0ERixPQOdAtdjE2bhUSvQaWAn2Zmlebm7jWx_nr7596q8QnxfV9fO8NXrpqVrPE4R9gC68NFm-e8nafxKJlSfMheDs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/vega_vis","blog_url":"http://medium.com/@uwdata","application_instructions":"If you are interested in working with us, please join the Slack community and join #gsoc.

Making sure everything stays up to date and secure is time consuming and error prone.\n\nThat's where we come in.\n\n## One (Tungsten) Fabric\n\n[Tungsten Fabric](https://tungsten.io) is a secure software defined networking project designed for the cloud native, multicloud environment. Placing it on top of any IP network allows you to have a single portal for defining, monitoring, and analyzing your entire multicloud network, its security, and its performance.\n\nUsing Tungsten Fabric, you can write and deploy network and security policies that are portable to any cloud environment. All of your clouds can have a consistent and easily maintainable configuration. Standardized policies will make your security team happy, too.\n\n## Internet scale\n\nTungsten Fabric is designed from the ground up to be as fast, as secure, and as scaleable as you need. From small private networks to Tier 1 ISPs, Tungsten Fabric can handle it…and we have users and contributors from both and everything in between! Working with Tungsten Fabric will give you a lot of experience with and knowledge about our industry.\n\nJoin us!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/RipiO2OXEwc4YFThvyicm3k0CVhyZCU-lk3G3e2WwOAL7VQOHtu-k7dToXUOAx3_Gkuy34XVd7GuVJ2nB81u-D1dQjsVmIk","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/tungstenfabric","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Applying to intern with Tungsten Fabric is easy! \n\n1.

We accomplish this using a decoupled server-client architecture, where data is distributed across both public and private servers while being securely combined and visualized in one web-based browser. \n\nWhile we are funded nationally by NCI, our users are international, with only ~40% of our traffic coming from the United States. We are committed to open-source software and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our static interval tree[http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree] and KM statistics[http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier]).\n\nStudents we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger UCSC Genomics Institute[https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/], whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease.\n\nWe aim to ensure that our students gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and code to the project. We are committed to putting the code from students out to production and into the world where it is used by real cancer researchers. In addition, we are always looking for long-term collaborators and growing our development team.

This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\n\n*Focused around Web Performance* webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\n*Built in JavaScript* webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.\n\n*Used at Scale* webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\n*Community Owned* webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only.

It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other team chat tools designed to help teams (whether [open source projects](https://zulipchat.com/for/open-source) or companies) collaborate effectively via its unique [threading model](https://zulipchat.com/why-zulip/). Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 500 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (140,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/vCwY6UYAqn5gkhQWL-vRohjT9bQKPtyb4WCFPq-GpPaAjvWRhb005JwJ1ML4k8JpXEhIuZcgQ0tgg4b72AVNnWpzG1_-IOo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/zulip","blog_url":"https://blog.zulip.org/","application_instructions":"Our application instructions are described in detail [on our project ideas page](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/gsoc-ideas.html)","topic_tags":["bots","mobile","visual design","chat","great developer tooling"],"technology_tags":["python","react native","django","javascript","electron"],"proposal_tags":["zulip-terminal","zulip-electron","zulip-mobile","python-zulip-api","design","api and integrations","docker-zulip"],"ideas_list":"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/gsoc-ideas.html","contact_method":"https://chat.zulip.org/","program_year":2019},{"id":6487755463327744,"name":"ZynAddSubFX","slug":"zynaddsubfx","website_url":"http://zynaddsubfx.sf.net","category":"graphics","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/support.html","irc_channel":"http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/support.html","tagline":"An open source musical software synthesizer with a wide range of possibilities","precis":"ZynAddSubFX is a realtime open source musical software synthesizer creating a variety of sounds from scratch.","description":"What is ZynAddSubFX?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nZynAddSubFX is a cross platform synthesizer which provides a wide range of functionality to go from a basic oscillator to a full virtual musical instrument. A quick overview of some features includes:\n\n- Polyphonic with support for legato and mono playing modes\n- Three synthesizer engines:\n  - Additive Synthesis for classic synth sounds composed of a variety of voices with powerful modulation. This exposes modulators ranging from LFOs and envelopes to oscillator modulators for FM, PM, and AM.\n  - Subtractive Synthesis for creating variable bandwidth harmonics from filtered white noise\n  - PAD synthesis for creating beautiful pads and other instruments\n- Powerful waveform generator with up to 128 sine/non-sine harmonics\n- A variety of filters including analogue modeled filters, formant filters, and state variable filters.\n- Envelopes can have ADSR (or ASR, etc..) modes or can be free modes (with any shape)\n- Effects for Reverb, Echo, Chorus/Flange, Phasing, Wave-shaping, Equalizing, Dynamic Filtering with flexible signal routing\n- A custom Ruby based window toolkit for optimal embeddability and scriptability\n\nWhat makes ZynAddSubFX different?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompared to other audio synthesis applications ZynAddSubFX offers a large number of simple building blocks in a mostly fixed signal routing. Each component on it's own is easy to understand, but once all the components interact, then new sounds can emerge and interesting modulation possibilities open up. Overall there are millions of parameters which can be manipulated from the user interface or via the open sound control API. With the collection of building blocks provided to users a powerful sound design tool is provided along with an interesting variety of development challenges. The challenges range from workflow issues, to signal processing trade-offs, to user interface refinements, and more.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/4DN1vNb3uZ53Bi0qgNL6P_lIV5GikysEh9UIDdanMhYohiv9djYB_aGG22l5ePBRIRVPomqy0a5IPvBFeyV6NezSFukaaA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"It is strongly recommended that applicants submit a small code related contribution to ZynAddSubFX before submitting their proposal.
